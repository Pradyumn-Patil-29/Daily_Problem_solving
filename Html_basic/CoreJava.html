        <h3>description</h3>
        <p>Core Java by Cay S. Horstmann and Gary Cornell was originally published in the Java series of Sun Microsystems Press and is now published by Prentice-Hall. The book is aimed at experienced programmers who want to learn how to write useful Java applications. No hype, no toy code, no language lawyering, just solid facts and in-depth research to help you write real programs.

            “What makes Core Java the definitive work on the language is more than its vast scope—it is the quality of the presentation.”—Andrew Binstock
            
            “Cornell and Horstmann make the details of this powerful and expressive language understandable, and they also furnish a conceptual model for its object-oriented foundations.”—Grady Booch.
